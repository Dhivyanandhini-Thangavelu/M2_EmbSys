# 1 About Industrial automation using IOT with data monitoring and controlling:

## 1.1 Description:
* Automation is one of the increasing needs with in industries as well as for reduces the human efforts by replacing the human efforts by system which are self operated, The Internet is one way of the growing plat from for automation, through which new advancement are made through which on easily monitor as well control the system using internet. 
* As in this project making use of Internet the system becomes secured and live data monitoring is also possible using IoT system. Within industries the various hazardous gas is being processed, hence to provide security to those employ working within those industries, it becomes important issue to work on their security, if leakage of gas takes place then these system alerts by turning ON alarm which notifies the employers. 
* This system also helps us take some crucial decision from any point of the world within internet network. Wi-fi shield is being used to act as service point between network and connecting network.

## 1.3 Identifying  features:
* The IR sensor counts the number of products manufactured in the industries.
* The temperature sensor senses the real-time temperature with humidity of products manufactured to find out the fault products. 
* The inductive proximity detects the metal movement and is interfaced with Arduino to detect the machine processing count.
* Output measurements and required values shall be dispplayed in LCD.

## 1.4 State of art:

* The main goal of  the project is to clarrify management issues.
* Automated data collection in real time system.
* To reduce the manual observation of machine process.
* To reduce the manual observation of machine process.
* The data acquisition is automatically monitored in excel system.
* The data is analyzed in ESP8266 and also stored in database.
