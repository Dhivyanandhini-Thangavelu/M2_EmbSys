### 1.3 SENSORS:

#### INFRARED SENSOR ( IR SENSOR ):

* IR detectors are specially filtered for Infrared light, they are not good at detecting visible light. 
*  In a defined angle range, the sensor elements detect the heat radiation (infrared radiation) that changes over time and space due to the movement of people. 
*  The main benefits of IR sensors are low power usage, their simple design & their convenient features.
*  IR signals are not noticeable by the human eye. The IR radiation in the electromagnetic spectrum can be found in the regions of the visible & microwave.

#### TEMPERATURE SENSOR (THERMISTOR):

* Temperature sensor will detect temperature or heat.
* Temperature Sensors measure the amount of heat energy or even coldness that is generated by an object or system, allowing us to “sense” or detect any physical change to that temperature producing either an analogue or digital output.

#### PROXIMITY SENSOR:

* A proximity sensor is a sensor which detects the presence of nearby objects without any physical contact.
* This can be done using the electromagnetic field or electromagnetic radiation beam in which the field or return signal changes in the event of the presence of any object in its surrounding.
*  It can detect both metallic and non-metallic objects, including liquid, powders, and granular elements.

## 1.4 ACTUATORS:

### LCD DISPLAY WITH I2C:

* It is much easier to connect an I2C LCD than to connect a standard LCD. You only need to connect 4 pins instead of 12. 
* Start by connecting VIN pin to the 5V output on the Arduino and connect GND to ground. Now we are remaining with the pins that are used for I2C communication.  
* Each Arduino Board has different I2C pins which should be connected accordingly. On the Arduino boards with the R3 layout, the SDA (data line) and SCL (clock line) are on the pin headers close to the AREF pin. They are also known as A5 (SCL) and A4 (SDA).
