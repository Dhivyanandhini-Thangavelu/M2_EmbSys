## Components reuired:

### Transformer:
* A transformer is a device that transfers electric energy from one alternating-current circuit to one or more other circuits, either increasing (stepping up) or reducing (stepping down) the voltage.
* A transformer works on the principle of mutual induction. 
* Mutual induction is the phenomenon by which when the amount of magnetic flux linked with a coil changes, an E.M.F. is induced in the neighboring coil. A transformer is made up of a rectangular iron core.

### Rectifier:
* A rectifier is an electrical device composed of one or more diodes that converts alternating current to direct current.
*  A diode is like a one-way valve that allows an electrical current to flow in only one direction. 
*  This process is called rectification.

### Regulator:
* A voltage regulator generates a fixed output voltage of a preset magnitude that remains constant regardless of changes to its input voltage or load conditions.
* It compares the output voltage with a precise reference voltage and adjusts the pass device to maintain a constant output voltage.

### MAX232:
* The MAX232 is a dual transmitter / dual receiver that typically is used to convert the RX, TX, CTS, RTS signals. 
* The drivers provide TIA-232 voltage level outputs (about Â±7.5 volts) from a single 5-volt supply by on-chip charge pumps and external capacitors.

### DB9:
* The DB9 connector is mainly used in serial ports, allowing asynchronous data transmission according to the RS-232 standard (RS-232C). 
* There are DB9-DB25 adapters that easily convert a DB9 socket to DB25 and vice versa.

### GSM:
* The Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) is a standard developed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI).
* It is developed to describe the protocols for second-generation (2G) digital cellular networks used by mobile devices such as mobile phones and tablets.
* It is a hardware device that uses GSM mobile telephone technology to provide a data link to a remote network. 
* From the view of the mobile phone network, they are essentially identical to an ordinary mobile phone, including the need for a SIM to identify themselves to the network.

### Microcontroller:
* It is a programmable integrated circuit (IC) that consists of a small CPU, RAM and I/O pins. 
* Microcontroller units (MCUs) are widely used in many devices.
* It stores the instructions and data required by the microcontroller.
* It acts as a communication medium between components for data transfer.

### Display:
* It is a flat display technology, stands for "Liquid Crystal Display," which is generally used in computer monitors, instrument panels, cell phones, digital cameras, TVs, laptops, tablets, and calculators. 
* It is a thin display device that offers support for large resolutions and better picture quality.

## Explanation:

* The circuit uses standard power supply comprising of a step-down transformer from 230 Volts to 12 Volts and 4 diodes forming a bridge rectifier that delivers pulsating DC which is then filtered by an electrolytic capacitor of about 470 microFarad to 100 microFarad. The filtered DC being unregulated, IC LM7805 is used to get 5V constant at its pin number 3 irrespective of input DC varying from 9V to 14V. 
* The regulated 5V DC is further filtered by a small electrolytic capacitor of 10 microFarad for any noise so generated by the circuit. One Light Emitting Diode (LED) is connected to this 5V point in series with a resistor of 330 ohms to the ground i.e. negative voltage to indicate 5V 
power supply availability.
* 8051 microcontroller is a low cost, low-power, high performance, most compatible 8-bit microcontroller. It is a 40 pin IC. It has 8K bytes of flash, 256 bytes of Random Access Memory (RAM), 32 I/O lines, watchdog timer, two data pointers, three 16-bit timer/counters, a six-vector two level interrupt architecture, a full duplex serial port, onchip oscillator, and clock circuitry. 
* The MAX232 is an integrated circuit that converts signals from an RS-232 serial port to signals suitable for use in TTL compatible digital logic circuits, so that devices working on TTL logic can share the data with devices connected through serial port (DB9 Connector). The DB9 (originally DE-9) connector is a 9-pin plug mainly used for serial connections, allowing for the asynchronous transmission of data as provided by standard RS-232.
* A GSM modem is a specialized type of modem which accepts a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card, and operates over a subscription to a mobile operator, just like a mobile phone. From the mobile operator perspective, a GSM modem looks just like a mobile phone. A GSM modem exposes an interface that allows applications to send and receive messages over the modem interface. Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) is the example for the parallel port. This example doesn't use the bi-directional feature found on newer ports, thus it should work with most, if not all parallel ports. 
* These LCD modules are very common these days, and are quite simple to work with, as all the logic required for running them is on board.
