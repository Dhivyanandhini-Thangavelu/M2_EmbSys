## Components reuired:

### Transformer:
* A transformer is a device that transfers electric energy from one alternating-current circuit to one or more other circuits, either increasing (stepping up) or reducing (stepping down) the voltage.
* A transformer works on the principle of mutual induction. 
* Mutual induction is the phenomenon by which when the amount of magnetic flux linked with a coil changes, an E.M.F. is induced in the neighboring coil. A transformer is made up of a rectangular iron core.

### Rectifier:
* A rectifier is an electrical device composed of one or more diodes that converts alternating current to direct current.
*  A diode is like a one-way valve that allows an electrical current to flow in only one direction. 
*  This process is called rectification.

### Regulator:
* A voltage regulator generates a fixed output voltage of a preset magnitude that remains constant regardless of changes to its input voltage or load conditions.
* It compares the output voltage with a precise reference voltage and adjusts the pass device to maintain a constant output voltage.

### MAX232:
* The MAX232 is a dual transmitter / dual receiver that typically is used to convert the RX, TX, CTS, RTS signals. 
* The drivers provide TIA-232 voltage level outputs (about Â±7.5 volts) from a single 5-volt supply by on-chip charge pumps and external capacitors.

### DB9:
* The DB9 connector is mainly used in serial ports, allowing asynchronous data transmission according to the RS-232 standard (RS-232C). 
* There are DB9-DB25 adapters that easily convert a DB9 socket to DB25 and vice versa.
